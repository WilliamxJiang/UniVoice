# tobyAtHome

## Overview

tobyAtHome is a cutting-edge real-time voice translation software designed to seamlessly integrate with Zoom and enhance multilingual communication. Built over a weekend, this project demonstrates the power of modern web technologies and cloud-based services to enable smooth and natural multilingual conversations in real-time.

## Inspiration

The project was inspired by [*toby*](https://www.trytoby.com/), a start-up specializing in bilateral online translation for meetings. Fascinated by their product, I decided to build an "at-home" version that replicates their functionality. After creating the project and filming a demo video, I cold-pitched it to the company and landed an interview.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Voice Translation**: Enables bidirectional communication across multiple languages with high accuracy and minimal latency.
- **Zoom Integration**: Effortlessly integrates with Zoom to provide a seamless user experience.
- **Enhanced Speech Recognition and Translation**: Utilizes Google Cloud APIs for Speech-to-Text (STT), Translation, and Text-to-Speech (TTS) to deliver superior accuracy and natural-sounding translations.
- **Minimal Latency**: Ensures real-time responses using WebSockets for fast and efficient communication.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Real-Time Communication**: WebSockets
- **Cloud Services**: Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, Translation, and Text-to-Speech APIs

## Project Notes

- **Build**: Created over a weekend, showcasing rapid development and deployment capabilities.
- **Industry Recognition**: Landed a cold interview with a start-up backed by Entrepreneur First following the project demo.
- **Versatile Use Case**: Designed to facilitate smooth and natural multilingual conversations in professional and personal settings.
